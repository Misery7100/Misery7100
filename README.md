# Hi friend!

I have been developing and researching in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning for more than two and a half years. Started freelancing on Upwork and later, after reaching Top Rated Plus status, began working directly with clients. I have experience in both project work and long-term cooperation, so I'm ready to take on something interesting and new. In addition, I have experience in managing a small development team.
Regarding working cases, I developed and deployed various machine learning models (most often recommender systems and scoring models), designed and deployed APIs (Flask, Django), I have extensive experience in working with cloud services (GCP, AWS).

In addition, I am engaged in numerical modeling of the interaction of light with matter, in particular, high-intensity laser radiation with nanostructured targets in the plasma phase.

I'll be glad to work together :)
